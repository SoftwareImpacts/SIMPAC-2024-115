DEMLab is a program for performing numerical simulations of particle systems using the Discrete Element Method (DEM).

Its purpose is to offer a modular and extensible environment that allows immediate implementation and testing of several DEM models and formulations in small to medium-scale problems.

## Main Features

This program deals with the classical **soft-sphere approach** of the DEM.
The main characteristics of this method are:

- It is assumed that the contact between the particles occurs through a small overlap between them.
- Each contact is evaluated through several time steps in an explicit integration scheme.
- Contact models relate the amount of overlap between neighboring particles to the forces between them.
- Other physical interactions (e.g. thermal) may also be related to the overlap between particles.
- The shape of the particles is kept unchanged during or after contacts. 

The program allows for multiphysics simulations with the following **analysis types**:

- Mechanical (solves the kinetics and kinematics of particles).
- Thermal (solves the temperature and heat flux of stationary particles).
- Thermo-mechanical (solves both mechanical and thermal analysis together).

Only two-dimensional (2D) models are handled by the program, with the following **element types**:

- Spherical particle (assuming that all spheres move on the same plane).
- Cylindrical particle (assuming an out-of-plane length).

Almost all variables involved in the simulation process can be exported in one of the following **result types**:

- Text file.
- Graphs (plots and tables).
- Animations (scalar and vector results).

## Implementation Aspects

DEMLab is fully written in the [MATLAB][matlab_website] programming language,
and adopts the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm to offer modularity and extensibility.

The source code can run in any operating system where MATLAB can be installed
(the program is tested for version 2019b of MATLAB).

Because it is developed with a high-level interpreted programming language using serial processing,
code efficiency is not a priority and therefore only small to medium-scale problems should be simulated.

For large-scale problems, it is recommended to check the [DEM Application][demapp_link] and the [Thermal DEM Application][thermal_demapp_link]
of the [Kratos Multiphysics][kratos_link] framework.

## Instructions

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. Ad totam nihil in officia mollitia a quibusdam rerum qui error consequatur. Cum sint quaerat ut voluptatum libero sit fugiat distinctio ea dolor facilis ea aliquid velit At velit dolore? Vel sunt dolorem non ipsum amet in eaque accusamus ut aliquam odit ut tempore reiciendis est recusandae aliquam..

### Input Files

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. Ad totam nihil in officia mollitia a quibusdam rerum qui error consequatur. Cum sint quaerat ut voluptatum libero sit fugiat distinctio ea dolor facilis ea aliquid velit At velit dolore? Vel sunt dolorem non ipsum amet in eaque accusamus ut aliquam odit ut tempore reiciendis est recusandae aliquam..

### Running Simulations

To run a simulation, execute this script and select an appropriate parameters file with the _.json_ extension.
Multiple parameter files can be selected to run simulations sequentially, as long as they are located in the same folder.
Sub-folders with the simulation name plus the suffix "_out" are created to receive the output files with the results of each simulation.

### Loading Results

To load and show results from a previously run simulation, execute this script and select an appropriate storage file with the _.mat_ extension.
Multiple storage files can be selected to load and show results sequentially, as long as they are located in the same folder.
Furthermore, if a storage file named after the simulation name is located in the same folder of the parameters file, the simulation is restarted from the stored results.

### Testing

This script file runs the selected test models and checks if the obtained results agree with the reference results.

This script file generates / updates the reference result files of the selected test models.
ATTENTION: This action will overwrite existing reference results.
