	  6) Numerical integration:
	     -Call scheme objects to integrate Newton and energy balance equations;
	  
	  7) Store results: check if it is time;
	  
	  8) State update:
	     -Update kinematic (position,orientation,velocities,accelerations) and thermal state (temperature) of particles;
	  
	  9) Particles removal:
	     -Check if model has bbox;
		 -Call method to check if bbox is active according to interval and if particle is outside it in order to delete it and finish current iteration; 
		 -Check if model has sinks, if so, loop through them;
		 -Call method to check if sink is active according to interval and if particle is inside it in order to delete it and finish current iteration;
		 -Check if particle has passed its destruction time, is so, delete it;
