The geometric properties (e.g. Radius) are optional;
If the geometric properties are not set here, it must be set through the GeometryProperties of the ProjectParameters file;
If a particle is not set a geometric property, an error occurs;
If a geometric property is re-set in the GeometryProperties of the ProjectParameters file, a warning is issued an the latest value is kept;

* FixedConditions:
Multiple sets of each B.C. can be applied;
A warning is issued when any condition is applied to an element when it is not active (time when it is not created, already removed, etc);
If a B.C. is applied to a particle together with an equivalent I.C., a warning is issued and the B.C. is kept (a particle cannot be created with a value of a variable and, at the same time, this value is set to another one);
Intervals of fixed motion can be overlaped for the same element, and the contributions are summed;
Intervals of fixed heat flux can be overlaped for the same element, and the contributions are summed;
Intervals of fixed temperature cannot be overlaped for the same element either with other fixed temperature nor with fixed heat flux;
A particle is mechanically fixed if any of its motion components (translational or rotational) is fixed, otherwise its mechanically free;
A particle is thermally fixed if its temperature or heat flux is fixed (EBC and NBC respectively), otherwise its thermally free;
The temperature evolution of particles with fixed heat flux is not considered and it is kept constant during the interval;
The heat flux of particles with fixed temperature are not computed and will not be shown;
Outside the fixed motion interval, a particle is mechanically free and behaves normally, keeping the last velocity and acceleration;
Outside the fixed motion interval, a wall is static;
Outside the fixed temperature or heat flux interval, a particle is thermally free and behaves normally, keeping the last temperature;
Outside the fixed thermal interval, a wall keeps the last temperature;
Remember that not assign temperature are always assumed as zero, so it should be always assinged to particles and walls, at least the initial;
The fixed motion starts from the position/orientation of elements at the beginning of the interval;

* Materials: (multiple)
If no material is assigned to a wall, only the particle material is taken into account for computing the effective collision parameters;
The name of a VariableProperties can be set to any material property;
Before analysis start, the value of a property must be set according to the VariableProperties;

* GeometricProperties: (multiple)
Geometric properties are only assigned to particles;
All particle must have one assigned geometry (through the model part file or here), otherwise a warning/error is issued;
If a property required by a model is missing, an error is issued;
The name of a VariableProperties can be set to any material property;
If VariableProperties_name has the same name of one of the distribution names, waht to do? (reserve the name?)
Before analysis start, the value of a property must be set according to the VariableProperties;

All particles should have their interactions with all other elements defined (missing interaction definitions results in a warning);
Multiple mechanical or thermal models can be set to the same particle, as long as they do not redefine a type of formulation already defined (first definition is kept);
Best strategy is to sel a standar interaction to all and then set each one individually;
